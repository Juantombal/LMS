# LMS

CIMSOLUTIONS aims to develop an LMS (Learning Management System) for its employees. This system enables employees to automate processes such as course requests and their management. It should serve as a platform allowing employees to select trainings, courses, or certification programs. The goal is to automate the approval process through a workflow, followed by monitoring the progress. The system needs to be set up in a way that makes it easily accessible through other channels, such as a mobile application.
